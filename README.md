# PokemonShinyBot
A pokemon shiny hunting bot with a gui for ease of access for the user with various inputs and settings. (Only works on Heartgold and Soulsilver for now, but I am working on implementing functionality for the other pokemon games.)
# Usage
To use the program clone the repo or download the zip file and navigate to the folder once downloaded. Once in the folder open command prompt and install the requirements with the command: pip install -r requirements, then enter the command: python shinybot.py to run the script and open up the GUI.
Currently the program is only set up to function on 1920x1080 displays, but its fairly easy to alter the settings within the GUI in order to support other resolutions.
Confidence values for image recognition can also be adjusted in the settings within the GUI in the case that images are not being recognized.
# Useful Info
Currently the GUI only handles wild encounters, however, there are functions within the code for soft reset shiny hunting and shiny hunting for starters.
Feel free to add functionality to the GUI to access these functions.
Suggestions are also welcome!
